    came as an inspiration by Honorable Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of new India and
    ‘Scientific Social Responsibility (SSR) for CSIR. The objective of Jigyasa is to extend the classroom
    learning by focusing on well-planned research laboratory based learning for school students. The
    Jigyasa program thus initiated on the directive of Hon’ble PM in CSIR Society Meeting. Since
    2017, nearly 981 Jiygasa programs were conducted by CSIR labs. About 300,000 school students,
    15,000 teachers participated in different engagement modules by visiting CSIR Laboratories in
    close proximity till 2019 the beginning of the pandemic. During the visits, CSIR scientists directly
    interacted with the students and teachers. Several MOUs were signed between individual CSIR
    laboratories to bring in quality with value added research knowledge with Kendriya Vidyalayas
    (KVS), Navodaya Vidyalayas (NVS), Karnataka State S&amp;T Academy (KSTA), Atal Innovation Mission
    (AIM), NitiAayog, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB), NGO’s, stakeholders, individuals
    etc. Under the CSIR-AIM initiative, NITI Aayog’s ATL and CSIR’s Jigyasa program initiated a
    weekly webinar for school students which ran almost the whole pandemic period during last
    year and continues successfully till date. CSIR Jigyasa has created a YouTube Channel which
    consists of 8.6K subscribers. Recently, CSIR adopted 249 ATL’s (Atal Tinkering Lab’s) by joining
    hands with AIM-NitiAyaog. CSIR is open for collaboration and will be collaborating with many
